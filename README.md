# Travlr Getaways
A full-stack travel booking application built with the MEAN stack, featuring an admin dashboard and visitor-facing site.

Public Website + Admin SPA + Express/Mongo API

This was an application made by following the textbook in my CS-465 fullstack computer programming course at SNHU. 

This application aims to serve:
  - Visitors - Server-rendered website using Express + Pug that displays trips, resort info and contact details.
  - Admins - An Angular SPA for managing trips.
Both clients utilize the same Express REST API and MongoDB database.

## Features

Public Webstie (Visitors)  
  ✅ Home page with brand/intro content  
  ✅ Trips page showing all available trips with images, price, length, dates  
  ✅ Contact information page  
  ✅ Server-rendered via Pug templates

Admin SPA (Angular)  
  ✅ Trip listing with live data from API  
  ✅ Create trip form (validates and persists to MongoDB)  
  ✅ Image rendering from src/assets/images  
  ✅ Dev proxy so the SPA can call /api/* without CORS issues
